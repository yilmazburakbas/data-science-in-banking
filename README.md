# Data Science in Banking

In this project, I analized bank data to figure if a customer will take loan or not. I used ***missingno*** and ***matplotlib*** libraries
to check missing values. For outlier values, I used ***box plot*** and ***Local Outlier Factor (LOF)***. Lastly for modeling part, I used
***Random Forest*** model to make ***classification***.
